  <h1>Memory Game</h1>
  
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  
  <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso, or Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid facedown on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
  
  <p>Memory is a great way to keep your mind sharp and to practice focusing on one thing at a time.  You will find Memory to be a great way to zone out and clear your mind.  It's almost meditative!</p>
